# Links

Links are provided in both link and button styles. Links should always be used when clicking will redirect to another location. They should not be used to trigger on-page actions; use buttons for that purpose. Misusing buttons and links are a common accessibility failure.

Button classes do not control text size or font family; standard tailwind classes should handle that. Space between the text and the underline are managed with leading for underlined links; leading is controlled by button styles to keep padding consistent.
