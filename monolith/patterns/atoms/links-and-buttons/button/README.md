# Buttons

Buttons are used in an interactive context and when performing actions on forms. They should be used when clicking something causes something on the page to change; they should not be used to redirect to a new URL except in the context of submitting or continuing with a form.

Links are provided in both link and button styles. Links should always be used when clicking will redirect to another location. They should not be used to trigger on-page actions; use buttons for that purpose. Misusing buttons and links are a common accessibility failure.
