# Sagehen Report Email Template

This email newsletter should be generated by a CMS. Patterns are broken out into their own category here because they are unqiue to the email newsletter. All patterns make heavy use of inline styles. The markup here was (in large part) migrated from D7 without too many changes except to standardize some items and correct a few obvious issues. There's probably a lot more that could be done to prune this, but HTML email is bizarre.
