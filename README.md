# Pomona D7 to D8 Migration

This is the repository for the Pomona D7 to D8 migration. This repository contains both the Fractal styleguide (/monolith) as well as the custom theme and modules for Drupal.

Fractal houses the CSS, Javascript, and most of the template markup that is used in the Drupal theme. CSS and Javascript changes happen in Fractal. Most template changes, including the creation of new components, also happen in Fractal.

The Drupal material in the repository is limited to the theme and custom modules.

Local development is assisted by several Docker containers, not included in this repo.

My main involvement with this project was the integration of Fractal templates into Drupal templates, as well as configuration of the imports module for Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration.
